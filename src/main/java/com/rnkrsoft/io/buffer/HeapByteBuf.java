 * of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 * do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 * notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 * or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 * that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 * as modifying the License.
 * <p/>
 * You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 * may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 * for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 * for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 * reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 * the conditions stated in this License.

 * unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 * negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 * liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,

 * has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 * <p/>
 * 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
